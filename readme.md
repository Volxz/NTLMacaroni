## What is this?
I am a pentester and I enjoy breaking into Active Directory networks. Unfortunately this can be a messy job and requires cracking and dealing with many password hashes. When you dump a domain controller there is a lot of information that you really dont need for cracking passwords. All that is required is the NTLM hash and their username. (and sometimes the domain but shhhhh).

## Usage
```commandline
./NTLMacaroni [filename]
```

## Use cases
 - Penetration testing
 - Security auditing
 - Being a 1337 haxxor skiddie


## THIS IS MALICIOUS IT SHOULD BE REMOVED!
This tool is completely legal. If you chose to use it for malicious intent that's your prerogative but I take NO RESPONSIBILITY for your poor life choices. Read the license.
